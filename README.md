# coding_challenge-17

This coding challenge is all about **Artificial Intelligence and chatbots**. Following on from last months challenge, wouldn't it be cool if your portfolio had a chatbot that could interact with potential clients/employers. Providing them with information about you, your skill, your interests, your work and projects... The options are endless!

**Dont have/want a portfolio**
No problem, instead create a help-bot for something you are passionate about. Here are some ideas:
- An introduction to the wonderful world of coding
- An FAQ Bot for your Football team
- Facts on your favourite animal/movie/tv show

Please Use the **#coding-challenge** channel on Discord to discuss and share your work. At the end of the challenge, we will compile everyone's submission here.


## What is the Challenge?
Build a chatbot utilising IBM Watson AI! What is it going to do? That is up to you, it could be for your portfolio answering questions about you and your work, or about your favourite topic. 

Looks difficult? Don't worry, being a developer is all about making small steps towards the end goal. Along the way, you will learn all about AIs and how they work/function. Most importantly you will have another project to add to your portfolio to wow your clients/employers.

**Some handy articles to get you started:**
- [IBM Watson - How to build a Chatbot](https://www.ibm.com/watson/how-to-build-a-chatbot-2)
- [Bot Yourself](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2017/03/bot-yourself/)
- [Using Node to create a chatbot](https://medium.com/wolox-driving-innovation/watson-and-node-an-efficient-way-to-set-up-a-chatbot-6606a5a9f29a)


The rest is up to you to research and figure out. Use this as a challenge to learn about Artificial Intelligence (which will be very important in the future).


## The Rules Are:

1. You HAVE to use IBM Watson to create a chatbot for ANY topic you desire

2. **You have until May 31st at 11:59pm EST** to submit your solution (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message:  *-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"* . The bot will listen for the command and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded.

3. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 

## One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I recieve from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
